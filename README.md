# ðŸ“„ Technical Requirement Document (TRD)

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Name: Story-Based Microservices Platform  
**Date:** April 2025  
**Author:** Kanisius Wahyu Santoso

---

## 1. Overview

This platform consists of four main microservices: `Account`, `Notification`, `Story`, and `Comments`.  
Each service is responsible for its own domain and communicates with others via gRPC.  
User-facing endpoints are exposed through REST APIs.

## 4. Data Flow Example: Story Creation

### ðŸ“˜ User creates a new story

1. `POST /v1/stories` is sent to Story Service.
2. Story Service saves the story to the database.
3. Story Service calls `NotifyStoryPosted()` in Notification Service.
4. Notification Service sends notifications to the author's followers.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- All inter-service communication must use gRPC.
- Redis will be used as a caching layer in the Story Service.
- External user requests should only be handled through REST APIs.
- All services must log critical events, including errors and triggered notifications.
